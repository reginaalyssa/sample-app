# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Sample Application

This is the third application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). The application
will cover Chapter 3 onwards (up to Chapter 14) which will include
users and microposts (as with the Toy Application), and some new
features like a full login and authentication framework (including sign up,
password reset, account activation).
